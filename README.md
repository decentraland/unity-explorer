### Development Guides

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Plugins not compiling (e.g. "The type or namespace name 'Google' could not be found" error)

That happens if you haven't got GIT LFS installed. 

A simple way to confirm that is looking at this [Google.Api.CommonProtos.dll file](https://github.com/decentraland/unity-explorer/blob/50ddf83a3ff7eb76c6036904390d3298a24e2f88/Explorer/Assets/Protocol/Plugins/Google.Api.CommonProtos.dll) here in Github and compare its size (348KB) with the size of the one you have in your cloned version of the repo (it would be a 'placeholder' file with only 131 bytes aprox).

1. Make sure you have git-lfs installed, for example you can install it with `brew install git-lfs`.
2. Close Unity and step in the cloned repo root directory.
3. run `git lfs install`, `git lfs pull` and `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
4. Just in case delete the `Explorer/Library/` folder.
5. Open the Unity project again and this time it should compile correctly
