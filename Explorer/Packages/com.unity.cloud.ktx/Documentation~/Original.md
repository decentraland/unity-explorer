# Original KTX/Basis Texture Unity Package

This package's original identifier was `com.atteneder.ktx` (see [Unity Fork][fork] for details). You can still use/install it with that identifier.

## Via [OpenUPM][OpenUPM]

The recommended way to install is to download and open the [Installer Package](https://package-installer.glitch.me/v1/installer/OpenUPM/com.atteneder.ktx?registry=https%3A%2F%2Fpackage.openupm.com&scope=com.atteneder)

It runs a script that installs *KTX/Basis Texture Unity Package* via the [OpenUPM][OpenUPM] [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html).

Afterwards and further, optional packages are listed in the *Package Manager* (under *My Registries*) and can be installed and updated from there.
