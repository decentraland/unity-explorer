# Apple privacy manifest
To publish applications for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and visionOS platforms on the App Store, you must include a [privacy manifest file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files) in your application as per [Apple’s privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note**:
For information on creating a privacy manifest file to include in your application, refer to [Apple’s privacy manifest policy requirements](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/apple-privacy-manifest-policy.html).

The PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy manifest file outlines the required information, ensuring transparency in accordance with user privacy practices. This file lists the [types of data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests) that your Unity applications, third-party SDKs, packages, and plug-ins collect, and the reasons for using certain [required reason API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api) (Apple documentation) categories. Apple also requires that certain domains be declared as [tracking](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/) (Apple documentation); these domains might be blocked unless a user provides consent.
> [!WARNING]
> **Important**: If your privacy manifest doesn’t declare the use of the required reason API by you or third-party SDKs, the App Store might reject your application. Read more about the [required reason API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api) in Apple’s documentation.

The Unity Cloud KTX package does not collect data or engage in any data practices requiring disclosure in a privacy manifest file.
